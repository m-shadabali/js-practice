Self-Made Objects

1 DISCUSSIONS
Self-Made Objects
You often have to create objects when developing real-world applications. They help you organize a set of data and functions that work together. Think about what properties and methods you may use for a stopwatch object.

You can see that we named the properties and methods as follows:

elapsedTime is a property with a data type number. It displays the seconds that have elapsed since timing started.
resultsHistory is a property data type object. It displays a list of previous timings.
isTiming is a property data type Boolean. It displays the state of its timing.
isPaused is a property data type Boolean. It displays the state if paused.
start is a method data type function. It starts timing and sets elapsedTime to 0.
pause is a method data type function. It pauses the timing.
resume is a method data type function. It resumes the timing.
stop is a method data type function. It stops timing and adds the result to resultsHistory.
Object Dot Notation
To reference object properties and methods, you use dot notation. This is the object name, followed by a period, and then the name of the property or method. Let's use the stopWatch object as an example:

stopWatch.elapsedTime
stopWatch.start()
stopWatch.start()
stopWatch.stop()
Methods require parentheses after the name. If the method requires data input, the data is placed inside the parentheses.

The Array Object
Arrays are objects that represent a list of values. Each item in the list is called an element. To initialize an array, you can set it to an array literal. An array literal is a comma-separated list of expressions enclosed in square brackets, like so:

["Saab", "Ford", "BMW", "GM"]
Elements in arrays can be different data types. Often, all the elements are the same data type:

["Milk", false, 123, document,"Gold", -.9876]
Elements in a literal array can be expressions, but they are evaluated and only the expression values are stored:

[price - cost, Math.random(), document.title, someVariable / 2]
Variables and object properties can contain arrays:

let todoList = [
    "Wash Laundry",
    "Clean Silver",
    "Write Letters",
    "Purchase Groceries",
    "Retrieve Mail",
    "Prepare Dinner"
]
game.scores = [120, 175, 145, 200]
Array elements can be arrays:

notes = [
  [
    "Wash Laundry",
    "Clean Silver",
    "Write Letters"
  ], 123, "999-999-9999"
]
The array objects with useful properties and methods are as follows:

length is a property with a number data-type that displays the number of items in the array.
push is a method with a number data-type that appends an element and returns the new length.
unshift is a method with a number data-type that prepends an element and returns the new length.
shift is a method with a mixed data-type that removes the first element and returns the removed element's value.
pop is a method with a mixed data-type that removes the last element to return the removed element's value.
concat is a method with a function data-type that merges two or more arrays to return a new array.
Using the Console Object
The console object has a method called log that we can use to test expressions in a JavaScript program. It takes an unlimited number of expressions separated by commas. All the expressions we enter into the console window would work with the console.log method. It evaluates the expressions and returns their results in the console. Multiple expressions are separated by a space.

The console.log method will be used in the upcoming exercises. Let's have a look at its syntax:

console.log(expression 1[, expression 2][, expression n])
Here are some examples of the console.log method:

console.log("Odd number count started!");
console.log("Iteration:", i);
console.log("Number:", number);
console.log(oddsCount + " odd numbers found!");
console.log(document);
